# Project Overview
Our group, The Minions has decided to work on a solution for drivers, that would help ease their difficulties when delivering a parcel from one point to another. And Our solution offers customising routes routes for last mile deliveries, by letting drivers choose their own schedule. At the same time the table can be dragged and dropped thus, allowing this strategy. This local optimising done by the drivers intuition and them using our app, allows them to fully maximise their efficiency. Thus, our web application will help solve this need.

# What it does
**The Minions** has coded a web application, that generates the schedule of the driver. This schedule is flexible and the driver can choose where they want to go, after the routes will be shown on the map to guide the driver on how to get there and the timings will be generated in a table below.
